## Project Introduction
this code aims at simulating elastic properties of crystals, we investigate 2 kinds of crystal: Al and Si diamond, which represent two types of bonding, covalent and metallic bonds.

## Basic theory

- **Hooke theorem**
$$ \sigma = \varepsilon E $$
$\sigma$ means stress , $\varepsilon$ means strain , E means modulus of elasticity.

- **Poisson effect**
Atensile stress along the z axis causes the material to stretch along the z axis and to contract along the x and y axes.Thus define the  Poisson's Ratio $\nu$ :
$$\nu = -\frac{\text{lateral strain}}{\text{longitudinal strain}} $$

for isotropic crystal $\nu$ remain constant in 3 directions
