## Project Introduction
this code aims at simulating elastic properties of crystals, we investigate 2 kinds of crystal: Al and Si diamond, which represent two types of bonding, covalent and metallic bonds.

## Basic theory

- **Poisson effect**
Atensile stress along the z axis causes the material to stretch along the z axis and to contract along the x and y axes.Thus define the  Poisson's Ratio $\nu$ :
$$\nu = -\frac{\text{lateral strain}}{\text{longitudinal strain
}} $$
